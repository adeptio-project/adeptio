# Why should I trust in adeptio-project?

There was a fair start for everyone.

We don't own the majority of coin supply, because no premine was made.

All dev funds addresses can be found by [public explorer](https://explorer.adeptio.cc/address/AP4FBQdztKJJQMQYmvz5U9KGgf128BfwZu)

No "pump and dump" can be made at least from core team.

Hybrid algorithm ensures the security of network and distributes the rewards among the PoW/PoS and masternodes.
